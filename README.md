Upload and Compress: Add uploaded files to a ZIP archive


This class can add uploaded files to a ZIP archive.

It can generate HTML for a form to upload a file.

The class can handle the request when a file is uploaded and add it to a ZIP archive in a certain directory.

It can also generate a random file name so the uploaded file in the ZIP archive is unique, in order to avoid overwriting other files in the archive.

The class can also read the list of ZIP archives available in the upload directory, delete a ZIP archive, show a list of all files in each ZIP archive and allow to delete individual files in the archive.
